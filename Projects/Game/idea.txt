Game where its like super hot except time stops for a alimited time and you can move aroudn the room to get a better advantage



10-20 levels, each with mroe enimes and other shit like obstacles 

time will stop when you press spacce for a alimited amount of time 2 seconds where only you can move

maybe make a shop to get different guns you can use

Different types of enimes:
Wall bouncing enimes
enimes that only slow down when you stop time
enimes with different type guns (shotguns, machine guns, sniper rifles)


possible cool effect like david martinex in cyberpunk edgerunners is that you see copy of yourself when time is stopped
Steps to game completion:
1. Create classes for:
    Player
    enemies
    walls
    bullets

2. Make functional:
    player shoots bullets
    enimes shoot bullets
    time being stopped
    can move from holding back like golfinity on poki.com (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/mousemove_event use shit on this website)
